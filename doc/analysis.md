# Notes: Currencies (Absolute and Relative)
- Long/short base currency compared to quoted currency e.g., NZD/USD; Expect NZD to appreciate relatives to USD.
- Base/Quoted = Exchange Rate.
- Macroeconomic conditions determine which best combination of currency pairs to invest in.
  - **Interest Rate Differentials:** Higher interest rates attract foreign capital, leading to currency appreciation.
  - **Inflation Rate Differentials:** Lower inflation rates tend to preserve purchasing power and currency value.
  - **Economic Performance:** Strong GDP growth, low unemployment, and robust trade balances support currency values.
  - **Political Stability:** Geopolitical risks can lead to currency depreciation and flight to 'safe-currencies'.
- Therefore, look for conditions which disrupt these factors to identify potential currency movements, and place successful trades.

# Notes: Fixed Income (Government and Corporate Bonds)
- Too low interest rates lead to long term inflationary pressures. 
- Long term inflation erodes the real value of short-dated fixed rate bonds.
- Rising interest rates lead to falling bond prices in order for existing bonds to be attractive as new bonds issued at higher rates.
- Small changes in interest rates affect long term bond prices more than short term bonds.
